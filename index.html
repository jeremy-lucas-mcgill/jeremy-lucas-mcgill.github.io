                        Hello, my name is Jeremy Lucas, and I am an electrical 
                        engineering student at McGill University.

                        As an enthusiastic learner and coder both in school and as a hobby, I am passionate about working in the field of machine learning and AI, particularly in Reinforcement Learning. With my background in Electrical Engineering, I bring valuable insights into the physical requirements of computer chips and power usage for training these AIs.

                        I am bilingual and excel in teamwork, which has been instrumental in my journey so far. As a Boy Scout and Varsity Soccer player, I have honed my skills in sharing ideas and resolving conflicts. Leading my scout troop for six months helped me perfect my organizational skills and prepared me to handle any challenges. My teammates and fellow scouts have always seen me as a leader and a friend. I have also collaborated effectively with other students during classroom lab sessions and in the NeuroAI Research.

                        In my personal projects, I am currently developing a video game called "Wonder Well." I handle all the coding in C#, create pixel art characters, and compose the music. This project has taught me a great deal about problem-solving, planning, and testing. Additionally, I make electronic beats in my free time, which I have sold to artists I connected with through social media. I deeply enjoy my hobbies and look forward to applying the programming knowledge I have acquired in my future career.
